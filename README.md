## Overview

This is the first challenge I've done on Frontend Mentor. My goal in developing this project was to practice HTML5 and CSS3 concepts, especially element positioning and responsiveness. 
I learned in practice these concepts that I will definitely be able to use in my future projects. This was a challenging experience and after completing it, I feel ready to develop more complex challenges!

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

## My process

I started the challenge by developing the mobile version (mobile first is the best, right?). My first step was to define the dimensions, element positioning, margins, and padding. To do this, I pursued using relative distance units and Flexbox. Next, I adjusted the background colors and the style of the button and fonts. The last step of this project was setting the desktop version by creating a media query.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The Object-fit property

```css
img {
    max-height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    object-fit: cover;
    object-position: 50% 30%;
}
```

### Continued development

These are my first steps in the frontend world and it is only the tip of an iceberg. The challenge was very exciting and I'll keep studying content related to HTML5 and CSS3 in order to feel more comfortable with Flexbox and Grid. So that I can be able to develop responsive pretty websites. 

### Useful resources

- [CSS property: object-fit](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) - This helped to understand object-fit property and its possible values.
